**Machine Learning Self-Study**


This repository contains my personal journey as I self-study machine learning from the textbook "Introduction to Statiscal Learning in R" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani.
The repository showcases my learning process, the challenges I encountered, and the solutions I developed through hands-on coding exercises and implementations in R. I am passionate about data science
and want to hone my skills to make me a more effective data scientist. For each chapter, I list the topics covered to provide visitors an overview of the skills I am learning. I then
complete exercises from the textbook to both practice the material and demonstrate my ability.
